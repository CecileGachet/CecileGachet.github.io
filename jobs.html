 <p> <em class = "new">* New *</em> We are looking to hire a <strong><em>doctoral student</em></strong> at the Chair of Algebraic Geometry for a period of 3 years with an <em>expected starting date on September 1st, 2025</em>. Some flexibility with the starting date can be discussed.</p>

<br>
<h3> Topics of research </h3>
<div style="background-color: navy; height: 2px;">
</div>

<p> The <a href = "https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/fakultaet/arbeitsbereiche/analysis/research-team-gachet/">Chair of Algebraic Geometry</a> at the <a href = "https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en">Faculty of Mathematics</a> at Ruhr-University Bochum works in the field of complex algebraic and birational geometry. </p>

<p> Using methods from Mori theory and the study of families of rational curves on varieties, Fano and K-trivial varieties are investigated with regard to their symmetry groups, their possible fiber structures, their topology, the positivity of their tangent sheaf and other properties. </p>

<p>More modern notions such as Calabi—Yau pairs and singularities of the Minimal Model Program also play a role in this context.</p>

<p> You can also take a look at my recent publications <a href = "research.html">here</a> or email me if you want to know more about possible themes and topics for a PhD project under my supervision.</p>

<br>
<h3> Your tasks as a doctoral student in my group would involve </h3>
<div style="background-color: navy; height: 2px;">
</div>
<ul>
<li> Acquiring expertise on one or more of the chair's research topics.</li>
<li> Creating scientific publications in complex algebraic geometry.</li>
<li> Communicating your scientific results in seminars and conferences.</li>
<li> Holding exercises and creating exercise sheets for undergraduate courses in the amount of 3 German semester hours per week.</li>
<li> Participating actively in a reading seminar (in the area of ​​complex/algebraic geometry) per semester.</li>
<li> Attending our joint guest seminar with the <a href = "https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/fakultaet/arbeitsbereiche/analysis/gruppe-lehn/">group of Christian Lehn</a> regularly.</li>
</ul>

<p> We strive to offer a welcoming, diverse, and inclusive work environment at the university's, the faculty's and the chair's levels. The Ruhr University Bochum  stands for diversity and equal opportunities. We therefore promote the collaboration of heterogeneous teams and the career paths of people who are underrepresented in the respective work areas. The RUB expressly encourages applications from women. Applications from people with disabilities are also very welcome. </p>
